# Wind Turbine Controllers with NREL Fast and Matlab/Simulink
This repository has a few controllers for the 5-MW Reference Wind Turbine for Offshore System Development.
The controllers are implemented through Matlab / Simulink.

We start with a simple 1-DOF controller, where we consider only the rotor.
The complexity of the system is increased up to 11 DOF, where we use MBC techniques to extract important features, don't worry, the details will be on the appropriate folder.
On the control side, we start with a simple feedback controller until we reach an Artificial Neural Network based controller. In the process, we'll see state estimator (Kalman Filter), disturbance rejection and gain scheduling, all in due time.

Ok, let's cut to the chase, you're here to see some pretty graphs and poor explanation.

These are the topics covered in this tutorial:

1. [Set-up Environment](./Set-up%20Environment)
2. [Linearization](./Linearization)
3. [State Space Feedback](./State%20Space%20Feedback)
4. [State Space Observer](./State%20Space%20Observer)
5. [Artificial Neural Network based Gain Scheduling](./ANN%20GS)
6. [Comparing Controllers](./Comparing%20Controllers)




## Other info and disclaimers:

Controllers designed to the 5MW NREL wind turbine using the MATLAB Simulink and FAST V8.
Note: OpenFAST is already available and it's open-source, the reason I'm still using FAST V8 is that my MATLAB is an older version not supported on the most recent FAST distribution.

The [FAST](https://nwtc.nrel.gov/FAST) software is distributed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 

Matlab and Simulink are property of [Mathworks](http://www.mathworks.com/);

The Matlab version used in this project is the Matlab R20017b

The FAST version used was FAST V8(v8.16.00a-bjj)

For Linearization, I used FAST V7 mainly because the output file (.lin) is easier to extract the desired information.
